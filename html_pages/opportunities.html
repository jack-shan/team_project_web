          Digital inclusion has become a popular topic in the modern world. As technology continues to develop there are often societal
          rifts that are created leaving parts of the population in the past. Often, it is our senior citizens that are left behind.
          This results in the older population feeling lost, confused and lonely. This is detrimental to the mental health of seniors
          and confusing modern interfaces only make this issue worse. Some people describe this issue as a loneliness epidemic this highlights
          the critical role of social connection for individual and societal wellbeing (Broadbent 2023). 
        </p>

        <p>
          Loneliness is an ever-growing issue across the entire population, though it is most prevalent among senior citizens.
          This has opened an opportunity for companies to experiment with AI robotic companions. Some companies such as ElliQ have already
          found success in this field. ElliQ is an AI powered robotic companion, it features a head that can move around and express emotion as
          well as tablet-like interface. ElliQ has been making waves in the robotic companion field since its release in 2022. For example, in 2022 ElliQ
          had over 300,000 interactions with users, around 40% of these interactions involved simple companionship such as users drinking coffee or tea with ElliQ
          (Broadbent 2023). Companion robots have already been successful in decreasing loneliness, providing companionship, and increasing wellbeing in seniors.
          Robots such as ElliQ also allow the user to connect with others, such as family and friends, this greatly improves social connection for elderly people as 
          they often struggle to use smart phones and other modern interfaces.
        </p>

        <p>
          Due to the rapid improvements of AI technology these companions are now able to offer a very realistic representation of a human-to-human relationship.
          Due to the nature of artificial intelligence, the robot will continue to learn and further develop its relationship with the user. AI also allows these
          companions to express emotion based off the conversation; this is a huge leap from old robotic companions that could only express limited emotions which
          usually had to be triggered by physical input. The expression of these emotions creates a more engaging and rewarding user experience, it also results in a more real interaction.  
        </p>

        <p>
          Though some companies are taking a different approach, instead of creating an enhanced chat bot, companies such as LOVOT have created a robot that is
          more closely related to a pet. ElliQ can show affection but LOVOT's sole purpose is to create an emotional connection with the user by showing love and affection,
          LOVOT calls this technology “Emotional Robotics”. This approach is very interesting because it is basically replicating the satisfaction of owning a pet without
          all the difficult stuff. LOVOT does not talk but it makes noises based off its mood and how the user treats it, it is able to move around via sensors and wheels
          at its base, it even begs for attention when it is feeling lonely. Companions such as LOVOT offer senior citizens with a purpose if they are feeling lost, LOVOT
          encourages the user to nurture it and in return it offers love.

          We know now that AI robotic companions are great for the mental wellbeing of seniors, but they can also improve the physical health of our elderly citizens.
          These companions can also encourage the seniors to get up and move around or do simple exercises. It is crucial to stay active to maintaining physical health
          and mobility in old age, the gentle assistance is a significant motivation for seniors to keep their physical health. Moreover, some robots can also remind the
          user to take medication, which is a vital feature because it is easy for seniors to forget their medication especially if they are developing impairments such as dementia.
          These features increase independence and motivate the user to stay healthy, it may also extend the amount of time that seniors can stay in their homes before moving
          into assistive living centres (Portacolone et al., 2020). 
        </p>

        <p>
          With the ability to learn and become personalized to each user, AI robotic companions could have the ability to access seniors' health details and give
          out simple exercises to improve seniors' health issues. Such as offering a variety of games, puzzles, and learning opportunities to challenge the mind 
          and keep it active. It could design these activities to the personal interests and cognitive abilities of each senior, providing both engaging and 
          beneficial experiences for mental health. For seniors with cognitive impairments or dementia, AI robotic companions could offer therapeutic interventions 
          that are created to slow cognitive decline and enhance daily life. For example, they could engage with seniors in conversations about their past experiences, 
          helping them to simulate memory and cognitive function (Portacolone et al., 2020). 
        </p>

        <p>
          There is potential that AI robotic companions can emerge with advanced health monitoring. These enhancements could include the ability to track vital signs such
          as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate. With these sensors, AI robotic companions could monitor the health status of seniors to detect any issues or
          signs of health issues. By having continuous health monitoring, AI robotic companions could notify caregivers or medical professionals or notify emergency operators
          if needed. This approach to health management could possibly have a significant impact on the early detection of some conditions such as heart disease, respiratory
          problems, or signs of cognitive decline, and allow early intervention that could improve the outcome.

          Regarding the concerns surrounding AI companions taking over and replacing human interaction, is an extensive debate that includes quite a lot of grey areas.
          In theory there is a straightforward answer, this being, simply don't allow it to happen by still having human caregivers and family present.
          Though as AI technology and AI in robotics continues to develop these companions will likely become a huge aspect of connecting seniors to the modern
          world and in the caregiving / medical space. We need to ensure that ARCFS will only ever be a tool for humans to use when needed rather than a method to fully
          replace human interaction which in turn will lead to more isolation. Despite the efforts of connecting seniors to the modern world through AI robots there may
          be a point where the idea of AI companions backfires on society and results in seniors choosing artificial connection over real human connection. There will likely
          come a time when AI robotic companions become more efficient, more cost effective and more intelligent than humans in the caregiving field. We believe that this would
          be detrimental to the senior population, as it is a known fact that human interaction is crucial for the survival of oneself and our society as a whole. On the surface,
          AI companions for seniors seems like a very logical way to reduce isolation and depression among the elderly. Though as technology and AI technology in particular is
          evolving at an alarming rate at some point in the near future, decisions are going to have to be made. Do we allow the use of AI robots in caregiving situations?
          Do we limit AI companions to simple chatbots and pet-like robots? Or do we let the technology run wild and see where it takes us? We believe that there should be a
          balance between human caregivers and assistive AI companions. The key point here is assistive, the robots should be assisting both the caregiver and the senior.
          We believe that these robots should never fully replace the job of human caregivers, as this would likely result in even more isolation. It will also be crucial for
          more effort to be put in on a family / personal level, loved ones will have to be patient with their elderly relatives in order to prevent the dependency on AI companions.

          Privacy of the user and security of data is one of the main concerns surrounding the use and growth of AI robotic companions. Modern AI powered robots gather
          data in many ways, a lot of said data is personal to the user, this means that it should be confidential. Though bad actors are very interested in this sort 
          of data as it can result in them making a lot of money by selling it off. Even the companies that create the product may be inclined to sell this data in order 
          to generate more money, this is a huge problem, a bigger problem than it may seem. The majority of data collected from these AI companions is very personal 
          to the user which means they can be easily exploited by other companies if it is to be sold off. Put bluntly, this means that the government must get involved. 
          This issue of data privacy is larger than you and me, it is an actual legal issue and a breach of the user's personal rights. All of this results in a lot of 
          ethical issues and some very important decisions that must be made in order to protect the privacy of our senior citizens. Companies are all about making money, 
          pleasing stakeholders and meeting quotas. Though at what point does this become unethical? And at what point does this breach the users human rights? Their 
          rights to privacy and their security of the data that they are knowingly or unknowingly generating. We believe that the privacy of the users' data is the number 
          one priority, data is very valuable these days in terms of monetary value and this sort of data can result in detrimental effects if a bad actor gets a hold of it. 
          As aforementioned, we believe that this issue is larger than the common citizen and must be considered and addressed by governments and political leaders around 
          the world in order to ensure that sensitive data does not end up in the wrong hands or that greedy companies do not get carried away when dealing with such a real and prevalent issue.

          One key problem with artificial intelligence is the misinformation that it is able to spread. Since current AI and machine learning models simply
          pull information from the internet, it is easy for the programs to repeat information that is incorrect and or damaging to one's perspective on a certain matter.
          This is an exceedingly difficult issue as it is simply impossible to regulate the information that is uploaded to the internet. AI systems are also unable to 
          tell right from wrong in terms of humane morals, this adds even more complexity to the problem. At this stage in AI development, we don't know if the programs 
          will ever be able to uphold the moral compass of a human being, considering the fact that each human has a different set of morals that they abide by to begin 
          with. This means that the only reasonable option that we can see is that members of the user's family or close friends must be present some of the time in order 
          to challenge the potentially incorrect ideals that the companion may propose. As many people may agree, the elderly can either be very stubborn or easily malleable, 
          if the user is stubborn then the potential of misinformation may not affect them. Though this is not the case for many seniors and people in general, some are easily 
          convinced especially if they are told this misinformation by an already acquainted, chatty AI companion. Hence why this issue is the most problematic of the bunch.  
        </p>

        <p>
          At the end of the day, what we suggest is that it is crucial for human interaction to still be present in the day-to-day life of our senior citizens. 
          AI robotic companions can most definitely assist the human race in caring for our elderly population, but they must not replace genuine human interaction.

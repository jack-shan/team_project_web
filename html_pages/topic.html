        <h2>Topic Overview</h2>
        <br>

        <p>
          The topic we chose is <b>AI Robotic Companions for Seniors</b> (ARCFS) 
          this stems from the wider topics of, digital inclusion and technology for seniors.

        <p><b>What are ARCFS?</b></p>

        <p>
          AI Robotic Companions are a branch of assistive technology combining the latest advancements 
          in artificial intelligence with the old concept of robotic companions to help comfort, and provide independence to, 
          elderly living alone and retirement villages.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p><b>Why we chose ARCFS</b></p>

        <p>
          Every member in our group has grandparents and have inevitably had to help with IT issues,
          but this stems from the wider issue that is a lack of digital inclusion for seniors.<br>

          After a little researching we discovered that this isn't an issue isolated to New Zealand, and that one
          fascinating piece of technology trying to increase digital inclusion among the elderly are AI Robotic Companions, specifically the ones aimed at seniors.<br>
          
          This topic appealed to us as it uses a rapidly evolving technology to help solve a problem that has sadly been an issue for many years.
